### SnapperDuty

SnapperDuty is a simple PagerDuty integration for SnapChat (by way of WebHooks).  It uses a bunch of libraries already out there, including the awesome (memegen)[https://github.com/cmdrkeene/memegen] and (php-snapchat)[https://github.com/dstelljes/php-snapchat].

It is based on Sinatra and Resque.
